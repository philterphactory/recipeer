# Installation

Recipeer uses the prosthetic-runner system to run on Google App Engine.

You can download prosthetic-runner [here](https://github.com/philterphactory/prosthetic-runner), along with instructions on how to install a Prosthetic such as this one into it. Particularly see the section "Adding a prosthetic to the server" newar the bottom of the page.

You will need to add this entry to index.yaml:
